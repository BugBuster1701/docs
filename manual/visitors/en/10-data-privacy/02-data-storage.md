## Data storage

### IP address

It will not be stored, the IP address of the visitor. Except for detecting bots/crawler/spider, the IP address is also not used for further analysis purposes. With the IP address and other internal data a pseudonym is generated in the form of a hash value. A reverse calculation is conceivable, but only with considerable effort. The hash value is not associated with any other statistical analysis.

### Browser-Agent and Referrer

For the browser agent, it stores the combinations of browser, language, OS with a count value, not the complete Agent string. When the referrer URL is stored with count value and time stamp of the last occurrence, with no link to IP address or browser agent.
