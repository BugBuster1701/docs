## Data collection

### IP address

For detecting of different visitors the IP address is used exclusively. JavaScript and cookies are not used.

### Browser-Agent and Referrer

For additional statistics the browser agent is read and the referrer, if available. Both will be separately saved regardless of the IP address , and may therefore not be associated. (pure counting)
