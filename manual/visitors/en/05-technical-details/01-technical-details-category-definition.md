### Counting mode

Counting mode is selectable, server side or browser side:

* Load counting, server side by Contao
* Read counting, client side by browser
    * (only on Contao cache mode: server and browser cache / only browser cache)

With "Read counting" can be counted when the page is in the browser cache and will be called from it. The system setting "Cache mode" will be respected.

> **Hint** The display of current values will continue but only if the page is requested from the server.
