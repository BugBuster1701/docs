# Insert Tags

Insert Tags are wildcards that are replaced with dynamic content when a page is printed to the screen. The front end module used insert tags. A user needs this only if the front end module is not to be used, but the functions of the extension.

There is the Insert Tag to count the visitors, to show the current values (Visitors, Hits) and for the values of the day with the most visitors.
