## Create the front end module

A new front-end module is create with:

* Layout -> Themes -> Modules -> Add module

At first, enter the title, and only then select in "Module type": 'Miscellaneous'-'Visitors'. It changes the form fields. In 'Visitors category' now select the previously created category, then 'Save and close'.

Now, the front end module must be included in the layout:

* Layout -> Themes -> Layout -> Edit the used layout (Contao 2.9 and newer)

Include in 'Included modules' the just-created front end module (e.g. to left)
