# Overview Front end / Back end

The Stardate extension is normally only used with insert tags.
The calculation type can be selected via the parameter.

However, there is also a content element with which the function can be tested.
In the content element "Star Trek Stardate" the calculation type can also be selected.

There are currently 7 calculation types available for selection. 
The template "ce_stardate_default" then displays this.

The description of the [Insert-Tags][1] explains the individual species.
