# Data privacy

A few words about data privacy. Unlike most other visitor statistics tools, 
Visitors does not store the raw data and evaluates them later. 
The necessary evaluations are executed immediately. The final statistics are 
saved, except for the IP address, see the notes in the following chapters. 
Thus, the target of data avoidance and data minimization is reached optimally.
