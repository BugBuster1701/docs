## Data management

The hash values for the detection of different visitors are checked with every
call, Elapsed time hash values will be deleted. Holding time is equivalent to
the block time, the default value is 1800 seconds, ie 30 minutes.
Referrer values are currently deleted depending on the type after 90 or 120 days.

The number of visitors / hits per day is stored permanently, the other evaluations
are generated from it. This storage can be deleted via the back end,
the counter starts then again at 0.
