Here you can find the manual for the Contao 4 Banner Bundle. 

- Display of banner images and text banners with a simple form of weighting over priorities.
- There is a statistics overview in the back end.
- IP-based ReClick blocker was integrated (5 minutes). Forwarding: yes, Counting: no.
- The views within a period are not re-counted, if the same banner displayed. (10 minutes) The amount of time to block the view count can be changed.
- "Bot Detection Bundle", is installed automatically. This prevents counting of traffic from bots / search engines.
