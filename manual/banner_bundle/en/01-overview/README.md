# Overview

A banner advertisement extension for Contao 4 with a simple form of weighting.
In the back end you can see banner view and banner click statistics.

IP-based ReClick blocker was integrated (5 minutes). Forwarding functioned, but isn't counted.
Similarly, the views within a period not re-counted, if the same banner displayed. (10 minutes)
The amount of time to block the view count can be changed.

Banner Bundle used the extension "Bot Detection Bundle". This prevents counting
of traffic from bots / search engines. But there is no 100% guarantee.
