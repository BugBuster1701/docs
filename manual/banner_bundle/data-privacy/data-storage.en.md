## IP address

It will not be stored, the IP address of the visitor. Except for detecting bots/crawler/spider, the IP address is also not used for further analysis purposes. With the IP address and other internal data a pseudonym is generated in the form of a hash value. A reverse calculation is conceivable, but only with considerable effort. The hash value is not associated with any other statistical analysis.
