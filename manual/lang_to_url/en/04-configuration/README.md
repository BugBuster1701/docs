# Configuration

In the back end on System -> Settings, you will find the section gibt es den Abschnitt "Add the language to the URL for individual domains".
First, the function must be activated there.

In the field "Domain name(s)", you can enter a comma separated list of domain names.

Example: ```acme.de, sub.acme.de```

The original field of Contao "Add the language to the URL" must not be activated!
