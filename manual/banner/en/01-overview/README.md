# Overview

A banner advertisement extension with a simple form of weighting.
In the back end you can see banner view and banner click statistics.

IP-based ReClick blocker was integrated (5 minutes). Forwarding functioned, but isn't counted.
Similarly, the views within a period not re-counted, if the same banner displayed. (10 minutes)
The amount of time to block the view count can be changed.

The extension Banner used the extension "Bot Detection". This prevents counting
of traffic from bots / search engines. But there is no 100% guarantee.
